# 8. PR-4 — Controlled AI Actions

## Goal

Move from read-only AI operations to **controlled operational actions**.

The central rule:

```text
User
  ↓
AI
  ↓
Tool Request
  ↓
Security / RBAC
  ↓
Policy
  ↓
Approval?
  ├── NO  → Execute
  │
  └── YES → Human Approval
                 ↓
              Execute
```

The LLM never decides whether it is authorized to perform an action.

---

## Feature 23 — Tool Security Contract

Define the common security contract for every tool.

```text
Tool
├── name
├── description
├── input schema
├── permission scope
├── timeout
├── retry policy
├── idempotency
└── approval requirement
```

Apply the contract to:

* `getServiceHealth`
* `createIncident`
* `triggerDeploy`

**Status: ✅ Complete**

---

## Feature 24 — RBAC + Policy Gate

Implement:

```text
User
 ↓
Tool requested
 ↓
RBAC
 ↓
Policy evaluation
 ↓
ALLOW / DENY / REQUIRE_APPROVAL
```

Rules:

* Viewer → read-only tools
* Operator → operational tools according to policy
* Admin → privileged operations according to policy
* Destructive actions → approval

**Important:** permissions come from authenticated application context, not from the LLM.

**Status: ✅ Complete**

---

# Feature 25 — Controlled AI Tools

## 25A — `createIncident`

Purpose:

* Create an operational incident
* Validate incident input
* Apply authorization
* Generate correlation/request ID
* Record audit event
* Return stable incident information

Example:

```text
AI
 ↓
createIncident
 ↓
RBAC
 ↓
Policy
 ↓
Execute
 ↓
Incident created
```

No infrastructure mutation.

---

## 25B — `triggerDeploy`

Purpose:

* Request a deployment

AI
 ↓
triggerDeploy
 ↓
Validation
 ↓
RBAC
 ↓
Policy
 ↓
REQUIRE_APPROVAL
 ↓
PENDING_APPROVAL
```

`triggerDeploy` must **not** directly deploy merely because the model requested it.

**Status: ✅ Complete**

---

# Feature 26 — Human Approval Workflow

Implement:

```text
triggerDeploy
      ↓
Approval Request

PENDING_APPROVAL
      ↓
Human
 ┌────┴────┐
 ↓         ↓
APPROVE   REJECT
 ↓
Execute
```

Endpoints:

```text
GET  /ai/approvals/:approvalId

POST /ai/approvals/:approvalId/approve

POST /ai/approvals/:approvalId/reject
```

Record:

* Approval ID
* Request ID
* Actor
* Tool
* Environment

**Status: ✅ Complete**

---

# Feature 27 — Idempotency + Timeout + Retry

Protect controlled actions against:

* Tool timeout
* Partial failures

Flow:

```text
Request
 ↓
Idempotency check
 ↓
Policy
 ↓
Execute
 ↓
Timeout protection
 ↓
Controlled retry
 ↓
Result
```

Deployment requests must not accidentally execute twice because of duplicate AI/tool calls.
